#An example of "Greedy algorithm"
This program simulates a simple change maker for a vending machine.

#Noted
It will start with a stock of coins and dollars.  
The user is then repeatedly requested to input the price for an item to be purchased or to quit.    
For a given a price, if the user has deposited enough money for the item, the program  
calculates the coins(only coins, not notes) to be dispensed in change.  
The user is able to cancel the purchase unless full payment has been deposited.  
After each transaction the program will update the stock of coins and dollars.  
Then it outputs the remaining stock of coins and dollars.  
If the stock of coins is not enough for a transaction,  
suggest the user to collect the remaning amount from staff.
